## Library Status

The Darlington Shared Library is maintained by David Cao, a member of the previous `5100` team.   
He has now turned his back and started working for the `4100` team since `5100` did not advance and their coach does not want to do 2 teams in the state tournament.   
This library is currently the 4th iteration, and the documentations can be found in [DarBots-Shared-Doc](https://github.com/DarlingtonProgramming/DarBots-Shared-Doc) Repository of this organization
